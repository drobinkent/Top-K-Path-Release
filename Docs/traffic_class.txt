# Isolation test :

run typical 3 types of flows and with that start a flow of special type with total volume = capacity of one link * duration.

At the end besides the other 3 types of flow, this special flow should get it's wcplicit bandwidth = one link capacity.

ECMP can not give this.



QoS Pefromance test:

random distribution generation. change the link capacity randdomly.

then say for each tenant link capacity is different. but ecmp can not adopt to thiese things.

so compare hula and p4kp


------------------
We simulated a multi tenant (t tenants) data cne ter environemnet using mininet. In this scenario, each tenant
consume some portion of a link's bandwidth capacity. Among  the  multiple tenants we focsued on 2 tenants
we focused on 2 specific tenant's performance in terms of qos performance in this case. The link bandwidth consumption
of rest of the t-2 tenants were modeled using a normal distriution. here each link's l_f portion was reserved for the rest t-2 tenants
and 1- l_f portion was used for the 2 tenants in sondiertation.

traffic designa and measurement :

the first tenants runs a real life workload observed in production data center. Where as the 2 nd tenant runs a dedicated
long term flow



First we evaluate Can P4KP be used as a data strucuture or api for qos aware routing to other algorithms.

then using simulated multitenant environment we measured how P4KP can be tranlsted into performance and qos gain.

 a real life workload was used


 for packet loss and jitter same traffic with udp protocol was used.






 =======================
 task:
 ======================

 convert the traffic generator to json based scheme. use those json scheme for tcp test using iperf.
 from their we can monitor rtt variation and other stuffs.



 Assume a VN with 3 types of traffic. The VN operator wants to embeed a graph with 3 links:

 a) .25x  link speed, .5 x link speed .8x of a link speed
 b) 3 types of traffic we will generate the traffic for each type according to their ratio .
 c) so our goal is to utilize these 3 links for 3 types of traffic .

 But if the oprtator wants they can deploy any load balancing scheme or etc. they can load balance their total traffic over the links.

 we have to actually show the tcam resource usage. if necessary need to implement a discrete calculator for differnt numbers of tenants

------
go back to variable linkspeed

we will compare, hula, ecmp, p4kp and range tcam.

then we will say ecmp can not cope with link variation hence not usable for qos aware schemes

then we will go for hula and ecmp range.

-------------------------
we have tio say qos is mainly imp[lemenyed in data center through overtlay networking. we evaluated p4kp in such a settings.





---- we have to implement the range tcam based version
---- hula
