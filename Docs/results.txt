say there are 2 aspect of evaluating p4kp.

a) scalablety if QoS aware paths rule in data plane.
3 tenants each need 3 flow with 8 pps,
b)



---------------------
we will say we are simutating the change in substrate network though link rate chaning.


path migration to periodically re-optimize the utilization of
the substrate network. We also explore node-mapping algorithms that are customized to common classes of virtualnetwork topologies.-- line to copy



substrate path capacity allocated to a tenant can be changed due to many reasons including a) change in substrate network b) periodic change in allocation for
optiization c) sharing the same substrate link with other tenant. modeling all of them sperately is out of scope of this paper.
Instead we mmodeled the overall impact of these factoes by periodically changing the lnk capacity


--------------------
traffi cdesign to show qos aware path selection capability :
This also realted to scalablety if QoS aware paths rule in data plane.

 assume 2 tenants each need 3 flow with 8 pps, mapped to 1 link
 one tenant need 32 pps capacity dedicated speed. so total 2 link
 and another link 16 pps .



 Now the controller and talk with hypervisor at startup and communicate the bitmask.
 the hypervisor will only tag the packets with bitmask for each type of traffic.
 (show the bitmask for each class in the hypervisor)

 In switch end we need only one tcam entry or just a single hash based entry to seect the p4kp copy for the
 tenant. Whereas for typical tcam based schemes for same functionality it would rewuire lot more entries.
 moreover, if at sometime


 assume the problem of fig 1c. for traffic class 1 we can set 0-20 and for class 2 we can set 21-40.

 so basically this approach turns into fig 1b which suffers from scalability issue.
 here we have to show hopw much tcam space it needs and how much savings p4kp can give.

 for a single tenant with N types of QoS based traffic classes it needs sigma N entries .
 for a generic 64 traffi classes if each entry needs 10 rows in tcam, 640 entries.


 so 2 point evaluation

 a) scalable qos aware packet forwarding
 b) performance improvements
