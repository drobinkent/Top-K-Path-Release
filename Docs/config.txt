in constant.p4 configure these 2 values

    const bit<32> MAX_TOR_SUBNET = 4;  //Maximum ToR supported by our simulation


In Top-K-Path/MininetSimulator/ClosConstants.py

    CLOS_MAX_PORT_NUMBER = 8

Run make state_clos a single time then stop the mininet. This will generate the topologyconfig file

Then in Top-K-Path/ConfigConst.py change the follwoing two values

    MAX_PORTS_IN_SWITCH = 8 #Maximum Supported ports in a switch to reflect the dataplane configuration
    MAX_TOR_SUBNET = 4;  #Maximum ToR supported by our simulation


then in  Top-K-Path/ConfigConst.py change  the data plane algorithm you want to use

    ALGORITHM_IN_USE = DataplnaeAlgorithm.DP_ALGO_BASIC_ECMP


In /home/deba/Desktop/Top-K-Path/MininetSimulator/ClosConstants.py file change the file name that you want to use the simulate the traffic

    TCP_SERVER_COMAND_FILE = "/home/deba/Desktop/Top-K-Path/testAndMeasurement/TEST_RESULTS/FlowInfos/WebSearchWorkLoad_load_factor_0.8.serverdat"
    TCP_CLIENT_COMAND_FILE = "/home/deba/Desktop/Top-K-Path/testAndMeasurement/TEST_RESULTS/FlowInfos/WebSearchWorkLoad_load_factor_0.8.clientdat"




bitrate :

assume 8 leaf to spine ports.
8*16 = 128 pps

find what is the average arrival time of a flow .

if we keep 4 paths for class 1.
and over test duration of T seconds, N short flow arrives.
Find what is the average lambda of the distrivution.
Now assue therer packet rate is P

then
